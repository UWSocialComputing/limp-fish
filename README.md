# NetWorked: Networking Assistant App

In today's fast-paced professional environment, cultivating a strong professional network poses a significant challenge, particularly for emerging professionals embarking on their career journey. Understanding the importance of meaningful connections, we've embarked on a mission to simplify and demystify the networking process.

## About NetWorked

Our solution is a mobile application named **NetWorked**, designed to foster genuine connections beyond superficial interactions like "likes" or impersonal "connect" messages on platforms like LinkedIn. **NetWorked** empowers users to thoughtfully select contacts from LinkedIn, in-person meetings, or other professional settings, whom they wish to develop stronger ties with. It enables users to set the frequency of interaction and schedule reminders for reaching out via their preferred communication method, be it text, email, or phone calls.

Recognizing that initiating conversation is often the most daunting task, we've integrated ChatGPT to offer customizable prompts tailored to the user's unique context. This feature serves as a conversation starter, facilitating deeper engagement and fostering meaningful relationships.
