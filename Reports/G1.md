# User Research Report
### Introduction
In our quest to understand the dynamics of professional networking and relationship building among undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates, we recently conducted a detailed survey targeting students at the University of Washington. Our aim was to discover their perceptions, practices, and challenges in building and nurturing their professional and academic networks.

### Methodology
The survey consisted of a series of questions designed to gauge students' experiences and attitudes towards networking. We utilized the AEIOU framework to structure our analysis, focusing on Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users.

### Findings
#### Activities
- Students engage in networking activities primarily through LinkedIn and email, but many express a lack of confidence or knowledge in effectively utilizing these platforms.
- Activities are often hindered by intimidation, fear, time constraints, and challenges in starting and maintaining connections.

#### Environments
- The academic environment is seen as both a facilitator and a barrier. While some students find ample opportunities for networking, others feel the environment falls short, particularly in practical training for networking skills.

#### Interactions
- Interactions are primarily digital, via LinkedIn and email, but there is a desire for more direct and personal guidance.
- Many students face challenges in initiating interactions due to intimidation or lack of confidence.

#### Objects
- Key tools mentioned include LinkedIn, email, and potential new platforms for more natural communication and community building.
- There's a need for enhancements to existing platforms and tools that facilitate the maintenance of networks.

#### Users
- Students have varying levels of engagement in networking, from active daily users of LinkedIn to those with minimal or no presence.
- Time allocation for networking ranges widely, from minimal to extensive, highlighting diverse priorities and approaches among students.

### Takeaways
- There's a clear need for more structured guidance and training in professional networking within the academic setting.
- Students desire tools and platforms that facilitate more authentic and less intimidating networking experiences.
- Time constraints and personal inhibitions are significant barriers to effective networking for many students.
- Initial data collection focused solely on undergrads; for a more complete picture of the issue there will need to be an additional round of data collection with graduate students and recent graduates.

### Design Challenges and Opportunities
- Developing platforms or programs that take out the mystery from networking and provide step-by-step guidance could address the knowledge gap.
- Creating more accessible and less intimidating networking environments, both online and in-person, could enhance student engagement.
- Leveraging existing platforms like LinkedIn with added features for easier and more frequent interactions could be beneficial.
- Creating a space to consolidate LinkedIn and LinkedIn-adjacent platforms (such as Handshake) for a more streamlined way of keeping track of connections, events, and opportunities could be beneficial.
